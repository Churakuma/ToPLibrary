## About

The application acts as a library or tool that allows user to store the current status of their books. The user can choose to add new books, remove them or change their status from incomplete to complete. 

## Improvements

I hope to soon add another option that allows user to login and handle their own accounts as well as potentially a third status of option of in-progress as well as an updated UI.

## Contribution
If you find any issues or have suggestions for improvement, feel free to create an issue or submit a pull request. This was a simple project I started to experiment further and develop my understanding of Web Development.

Thank you for using my web application! If you have any questions or require further clarification, please reach out!
